# Background

Driven by a desire to bring clarity to the often‚Äëopaque world of football wages, this study began as a quest to identify where payroll imbalances lurk and how they shape competitive dynamics in the Turkish S√ºper¬†Lig by surfacing the biggest earners, the widest pay gaps, and the most balanced rosters.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were: 
    1- What is each club's total annual wage bill?

    2- How large is the intra‚Äëclub wage gap, and how is pay distributed?

    3- Which positions command the highest pay across the league?

    4- Who are the top ten highest‚Äëearning players?

    5- What is the correlation between salary and age?

    6- How balanced are wages between domestic and foreign players?   

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the Turkish League Salaries, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

**SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

**PostgreSQL:** The chosen database-management system, ideal for handling the job-posting data.

**Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Turkish League salaries. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Total Salaries Per Club

To surface the clubs with the biggest payrolls, I summed every player‚Äôs gross yearly salary (gross_py_eur) by club. The query also returns the average salary per player and the squad size, helping benchmark spending efficiency.


```sql
SELECT
    c.club_name,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND(SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / 1000000, 2), 'FM999G990D00'), ' Mio') AS total_salary_mio,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND(AVG(f.gross_py_eur) / 1000000, 2), 'FM999G990D00'), ' Mio') AS avg_salary_per_player_mio,
    COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM fact_contract  f
JOIN dim_club c USING (club_id)
GROUP BY c.club_name
ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC;
```

Running this statement highlights the highest‚Äëspending clubs and reveals how much, on average, each squad member earns.

**Fenerbah√ße (‚Ç¨90.9‚ÄØm)** and **Galatasaray (‚Ç¨79.3‚ÄØm)** dominate spending, jointly absorbing almost 30‚ÄØ% of the league‚Äôs total payroll.

**Be≈üikta≈ü (‚Ç¨66.2‚ÄØm)** stands as a solid third; together the top three clubs account for more than half of all salaries paid.

The remaining 14 clubs sit at or below ‚âà‚ÄØ‚Ç¨17‚ÄØm, with Adana¬†Demirspor bottoming out at ‚Ç¨5‚ÄØm.

**Skewed distribution:** The mean club budget (‚Ç¨25.8‚ÄØm) is far higher than the median (‚Ç¨15‚ÄØm), indicating that a handful of heavy spenders pull the whole distribution to the right.

**Cost per player:** Each of the top three clubs spends >‚ÄØ‚Ç¨2‚ÄØm per player, whereas half of the league is below ‚Ç¨0.65‚ÄØm.

**High variance:** The standard deviation is nearly the same magnitude as the mean, underscoring sharp disparities from club to club.

### 2. Spread and Statistical Analysis of Salaries

To uncover how evenly (or unevenly) each club distributes its payroll, I computed the average salary, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation **(CV¬†=¬†œÉ‚ÄØ/‚ÄØŒº).** A higher CV flags a wider spread between high and low‚Äëearning squad members.

```sql
WITH club_stats AS (
    SELECT
        c.club_id,
        c.club_name,
        AVG(f.gross_py_eur) AS avg_salary,  
        STDDEV_POP(f.gross_py_eur) AS sd_salary 
    FROM   fact_contract f
    JOIN   dim_club c  ON c.club_id = f.club_id
    GROUP  BY c.club_id, c.club_name
)

SELECT
    club_name,
    ROUND(sd_salary / 1e6, 2) AS sd_mio,      
    ROUND(avg_salary / 1e6, 2) AS avg_mio,   
    ROUND(sd_salary / avg_salary, 3) AS cv     
FROM   club_stats
ORDER  BY cv DESC;
```
Running this query highlights the clubs with the largest salary spreads and the relative equality of their wage structures.

**Average CV ‚âà¬†0.97** ‚Äî the league sits on the cusp between ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù pay dispersion.

**Financial Fair¬†Play risk:** High‚ÄëCV clubs face sharper cost‚Äëcutting pressure if revenues dip (e.g., missing European qualification).

**Balance matters:** Kasƒ±mpa≈üa and Bodrum require urgent payroll re‚Äëbalancing; Be≈üikta≈ü and Galatasaray should monitor their widening gaps. Conversely, Fenerbah√ße, Konyaspor, and Kayserispor prove that balanced wage pyramids are achievable at any budget size.

**Relegation link:** All four relegated teams rank within the top eight for wage inequality‚Äîhighlighting the sporting cost of financial imbalance.

### 3. Payment Per Positions

To pinpoint which positions command the biggest slice of the wage pie, I summed every player‚Äôs gross yearly salary by position group (pos_group). The query also reveals the average pay per player in that role and its share of the league-wide payroll.

```sql
SELECT
    p.pos_group AS position,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS total_salary_mio,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( (SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / COUNT(*)) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS avg_per_player_mio,
    ROUND(SUM(f.gross_py_eur) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(f.gross_py_eur)) OVER (),1) AS pct_of_overall
FROM fact_contract f
JOIN dim_player  p USING (player_id)
GROUP BY p.pos_group
ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC;
```

Executing this query ranks forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers by total spend and average salary, spotlighting where clubs invest the most.

**Forwards (‚âà‚ÄØ45‚ÄØ% of payroll):** Almost half of the total wage bill is poured into attackers‚Äîclubs are betting heavily on goal production.

**Defenders (‚âà‚ÄØ29‚ÄØ%):** A solid second place; high‚Äëprofile centre‚Äëbacks drive most of the cost in this group.

**Midfielders (‚âà‚ÄØ20‚ÄØ%):** Cheaper than attack in aggregate, but still earn more per head (‚Ç¨0.86‚ÄØm) than defenders (‚Ç¨0.79‚ÄØm).

**Goalkeepers (‚âà‚ÄØ6‚ÄØ%):** Command the smallest slice and the lowest average pay (‚Ç¨0.43‚ÄØm).

![SpecificPositionSalary](assets/PositionSalaries.png)


To discover which role each club pays the most, the following query sums salaries by position group inside every club, ranks them, and returns the top‚Äëpaid position.

```sql
WITH club_tot AS (
    SELECT
        club_id,
        SUM(gross_py_eur) AS club_total_eur 
    FROM fact_contract
    GROUP BY club_id
),
club_pos AS (
    SELECT
        c.club_name,
        p.pos_group,
        SUM(f.gross_py_eur) AS pos_total_eur,  
        t.club_total_eur,                                       
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY c.club_name
            ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC
        ) AS rnk
    FROM fact_contract f
    JOIN dim_club   c USING (club_id)
    JOIN dim_player p USING (player_id)
    JOIN club_tot   t USING (club_id)
    GROUP BY c.club_name, p.pos_group, t.club_total_eur
)
SELECT
    club_name,
    pos_group AS top_paid_position,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND(pos_total_eur / 1e6 , 2)::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS pos_salary_mio,
    ROUND(pos_total_eur * 100.0 / club_total_eur , 1) AS pct_of_club
FROM club_pos
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY pos_total_eur DESC;

SELECT
    p.pos_detail AS position,                
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS total_salary_mio,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( (SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / COUNT(*)) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS avg_per_player_mio,
    ROUND(SUM(f.gross_py_eur) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(f.gross_py_eur)) OVER (),1) AS pct_of_overall
FROM fact_contract f
JOIN dim_player  p USING (player_id)
GROUP BY p.pos_detail
ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC;
```

Insight: Only three clubs **‚ÄîTrabzonspor, Kayserispor and Goztepe‚Äî** allocate a larger share of their wage bill to defenders; every other team channels the biggest slice into its forward line.


### 4. Most Expensive 10 Players

To surface the ten most expensive contracts in the league, I simply order every valid salary in descending order and limit the output to ten rows:

```sql
SELECT
    p.player_name AS player,
    c.club_name AS club,
    p.age,
    p.country,
    f.gross_py_eur AS salary_eur,
    ROUND(f.gross_py_eur / 1e6, 2) || ' mio' AS salary_mio
FROM fact_contract  f
JOIN dim_player p USING (player_id)
JOIN dim_club c USING (club_id)
WHERE gross_py_eur IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.gross_py_eur DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Running this query yields a snapshot of the league‚Äôs true elite earners‚Äîhelpful for benchmarking star wages and gauging how top‚Äëheavy each club‚Äôs payroll might be.

**Risk concentration:** Losing or under‚Äëperforming a ‚Ç¨10‚ÄØm‚Äëa‚Äëyear star wipes out a big chunk of wage ROI; squad depth and contingency planning are critical.

**Future wage inflation:** Heavy reliance on 30‚Äëplus players foreshadows costly renewals; clubs must either budget for raises or start succession scouting early.

**Local‚Äëtalent gap:** No Turkish player cracks the top‚Äë10; strengthening domestic academy‚Äëto‚Äëfirst‚Äëteam pipelines could ease FX exposure and FFP pressure.

**Club concentration:** Fenerbah√ße owns 6¬†of 10 spots (positions 5‚Äë10), while Galatasaray and Be≈üikta≈ü claim two each‚Äîmaking Fener the single‚Äëlargest spender at the elite end.

**Age profile:** Average age is 31‚ÄØyears¬†3¬†months; only Victor¬†Osimhen (26) and Youssef¬†En‚ÄëNesyri (27) are under 30, signalling clubs prefer peak‚Äëage certainty over future upside.

### 5. Correlation Between Salary and Age

To measure how pay scales with age, I first calculate the Pearson correlation between a player‚Äôs age and their gross salary. Then I aggregate salary statistics for each age year to visualise patterns.

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(CORR(p.age, f.gross_py_eur)::NUMERIC, 3) AS age_salary_corr
FROM fact_contract  f
JOIN dim_player p USING (player_id);
```

**Correlation coefficient:¬†+0.36** ‚Äî salary rises with age but there‚Äôs plenty of scatter; performance, role, and club wealth still dominate pay.

```sql
SELECT
    p.age AS age,         
    ROUND( AVG(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 ) AS avg_salary_mio,
    ROUND( MIN(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 ) AS min_salary_mio,
    ROUND( MAX(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 ) AS max_salary_mio,
    COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM fact_contract  f
JOIN dim_player     p USING (player_id)
WHERE p.age IS NOT NULL            
  AND f.gross_py_eur IS NOT NULL   
GROUP BY p.age
ORDER BY p.age;
```

![AgeSalary](assets/AgeSalaryRelationship.png)

**Density:** 75‚ÄØ% of all salaries remain below ‚Ç¨1‚ÄØm until age‚ÄØ27; beyond that, roughly 55‚ÄØ% of contracts break the ‚Ç¨1‚ÄØm line.

**Super‚Äëearners:** Every ‚Ç¨7‚ÄØm+ contract falls between ages 26¬†and¬†32‚Äîthe sweet‚Äëspot where star value and resale prospects intersect.

### 6. Domestic VS Foreign Players

To gauge how payroll is split between home‚Äëgrown and imported talent, I sum total salaries by nationality bucket and compute per‚Äëplayer averages and league‚Äëwide shares.

```sql
WITH budget_split AS (
    SELECT
        CASE WHEN p.country = 'Turkey' THEN 'Domestic'
             ELSE 'Foreign'
        END AS player_type,
        SUM(f.gross_py_eur) AS total_eur,
        COUNT(*) AS player_count 
    FROM fact_contract  f
    JOIN dim_player p USING (player_id)
    WHERE f.gross_py_eur IS NOT NULL     
    GROUP BY player_type
)

SELECT
    player_type,
    ROUND(total_eur / 1e6, 2) || ' mio' AS total_mio,
    ROUND((total_eur / player_count) / 1e6, 2) || ' mio' AS avg_per_player_mio,
    ROUND(total_eur * 100.0 / SUM(total_eur) OVER (), 1) AS pct_of_league,
    player_count  AS player_count
FROM budget_split
ORDER BY total_eur DESC;
```

**Three‚Äëquarters of the entire wage bill flows to foreign players**‚Äîfar heavier than the ~60‚Äë40 splits common in most European leagues.

**Cost ratio:** Clubs spend roughly ‚Ç¨3.2 on imports for every ‚Ç¨1 on home‚Äëgrown talent, underscoring deep reliance on overseas recruits.

**Efficiency gap:** If domestic players deliver comparable output for lower wages, some teams may be paying a costly ‚Äúpassport premium.‚Äù

**Regulatory exposure:** Any tightening of foreign‚Äëplayer quotas (federation or UEFA) would force a rapid wage‚Äëbill restructure; FX risk is amplified when 76‚ÄØ% of contracts are paid in ‚Ç¨/$ to overseas players.

**Talent‚Äëdevelopment signal:** The budget skew hints that academies and domestic scouting aren‚Äôt supplying enough first‚Äëteam quality, pushing clubs toward ready‚Äëmade imports.
