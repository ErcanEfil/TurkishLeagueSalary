# Background

Driven by a desire to bring clarity to the often‚Äëopaque world of football wages, this study began as a quest to identify where payroll imbalances lurk and how they shape competitive dynamics in the Turkish S√ºper¬†Lig by surfacing the biggest earners, the widest pay gaps, and the most balanced rosters.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were: 
    1- What is each club's total annual wage bill?

    2- How large is the intra‚Äëclub wage gap, and how is pay distributed?

    3- Which positions command the highest pay across the league?

    4- Who are the top ten highest‚Äëearning players?

    5- What is the correlation between salary and age?

    6- How balanced are wages between domestic and foreign players?   

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the Turkish League Salaries, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

**SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

**PostgreSQL:** The chosen database-management system, ideal for handling the job-posting data.

**Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Turkish League salaries. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Total Salaries Per Club

To surface the clubs with the biggest payrolls, I summed every player‚Äôs gross yearly salary (gross_py_eur) by club. The query also returns the average salary per player and the squad size, helping benchmark spending efficiency.


```sql
SELECT
    c.club_name,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND(SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / 1000000, 2), 'FM999G990D00'), ' Mio') AS total_salary_mio,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND(AVG(f.gross_py_eur) / 1000000, 2), 'FM999G990D00'), ' Mio') AS avg_salary_per_player_mio,
    COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM fact_contract  f
JOIN dim_club c USING (club_id)
GROUP BY c.club_name
ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC;
```

Running this statement highlights the highest‚Äëspending clubs and reveals how much, on average, each squad member earns.

**Fenerbah√ße (‚Ç¨90.9‚ÄØm)** and **Galatasaray (‚Ç¨79.3‚ÄØm)** dominate spending, jointly absorbing almost 30‚ÄØ% of the league‚Äôs total payroll.

**Be≈üikta≈ü (‚Ç¨66.2‚ÄØm)** stands as a solid third; together the top three clubs account for more than half of all salaries paid.

The remaining 14 clubs sit at or below ‚âà‚ÄØ‚Ç¨17‚ÄØm, with Adana¬†Demirspor bottoming out at ‚Ç¨5‚ÄØm.

**Skewed distribution:** The mean club budget (‚Ç¨25.8‚ÄØm) is far higher than the median (‚Ç¨15‚ÄØm), indicating that a handful of heavy spenders pull the whole distribution to the right.

**Cost per player:** Each of the top three clubs spends >‚ÄØ‚Ç¨2‚ÄØm per player, whereas half of the league is below ‚Ç¨0.65‚ÄØm.

**High variance:** The standard deviation is nearly the same magnitude as the mean, underscoring sharp disparities from club to club.

### 2. Spread and Statistical Analysis of Salaries

To uncover how evenly (or unevenly) each club distributes its payroll, I computed the average salary, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation **(CV¬†=¬†œÉ‚ÄØ/‚ÄØŒº).** A higher CV flags a wider spread between high and low‚Äëearning squad members.

```sql
WITH club_stats AS (
    SELECT
        c.club_id,
        c.club_name,
        AVG(f.gross_py_eur) AS avg_salary,  
        STDDEV_POP(f.gross_py_eur) AS sd_salary 
    FROM   fact_contract f
    JOIN   dim_club c  ON c.club_id = f.club_id
    GROUP  BY c.club_id, c.club_name
)

SELECT
    club_name,
    ROUND(sd_salary / 1e6, 2) AS sd_mio,      
    ROUND(avg_salary / 1e6, 2) AS avg_mio,   
    ROUND(sd_salary / avg_salary, 3) AS cv     
FROM   club_stats
ORDER  BY cv DESC;
```
Running this query highlights the clubs with the largest salary spreads and the relative equality of their wage structures.

**Average CV ‚âà¬†0.97** ‚Äî the league sits on the cusp between ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù pay dispersion.

**Financial Fair¬†Play risk:** High‚ÄëCV clubs face sharper cost‚Äëcutting pressure if revenues dip (e.g., missing European qualification).

**Balance matters:** Kasƒ±mpa≈üa and Bodrum require urgent payroll re‚Äëbalancing; Be≈üikta≈ü and Galatasaray should monitor their widening gaps. Conversely, Fenerbah√ße, Konyaspor, and Kayserispor prove that balanced wage pyramids are achievable at any budget size.

**Relegation link:** All four relegated teams rank within the top eight for wage inequality‚Äîhighlighting the sporting cost of financial imbalance.

### 3. Payment Per Positions

To pinpoint which positions command the biggest slice of the wage pie, I summed every player‚Äôs gross yearly salary by position group (pos_group). The query also reveals the average pay per player in that role and its share of the league-wide payroll.

```sql
SELECT
    p.pos_group AS position,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS total_salary_mio,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( (SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / COUNT(*)) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS avg_per_player_mio,
    ROUND(SUM(f.gross_py_eur) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(f.gross_py_eur)) OVER (),1) AS pct_of_overall
FROM fact_contract f
JOIN dim_player  p USING (player_id)
GROUP BY p.pos_group
ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC;
```

Executing this query ranks forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers by total spend and average salary, spotlighting where clubs invest the most.

**Forwards (‚âà‚ÄØ45‚ÄØ% of payroll):** Almost half of the total wage bill is poured into attackers‚Äîclubs are betting heavily on goal production.

**Defenders (‚âà‚ÄØ29‚ÄØ%):** A solid second place; high‚Äëprofile centre‚Äëbacks drive most of the cost in this group.

**Midfielders (‚âà‚ÄØ20‚ÄØ%):** Cheaper than attack in aggregate, but still earn more per head (‚Ç¨0.86‚ÄØm) than defenders (‚Ç¨0.79‚ÄØm).

**Goalkeepers (‚âà‚ÄØ6‚ÄØ%):** Command the smallest slice and the lowest average pay (‚Ç¨0.43‚ÄØm).

To discover which role each club pays the most, the following query sums salaries by position group inside every club, ranks them, and returns the top‚Äëpaid position.

```sql
WITH club_tot AS (
    SELECT
        club_id,
        SUM(gross_py_eur) AS club_total_eur 
    FROM fact_contract
    GROUP BY club_id
),
club_pos AS (
    SELECT
        c.club_name,
        p.pos_group,
        SUM(f.gross_py_eur) AS pos_total_eur,  
        t.club_total_eur,                                       
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY c.club_name
            ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC
        ) AS rnk
    FROM fact_contract f
    JOIN dim_club   c USING (club_id)
    JOIN dim_player p USING (player_id)
    JOIN club_tot   t USING (club_id)
    GROUP BY c.club_name, p.pos_group, t.club_total_eur
)
SELECT
    club_name,
    pos_group AS top_paid_position,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND(pos_total_eur / 1e6 , 2)::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS pos_salary_mio,
    ROUND(pos_total_eur * 100.0 / club_total_eur , 1) AS pct_of_club
FROM club_pos
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY pos_total_eur DESC;

SELECT
    p.pos_detail AS position,                
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS total_salary_mio,
    CONCAT(TO_CHAR(ROUND( (SUM(f.gross_py_eur) / COUNT(*)) / 1e6 , 2 )::NUMERIC,'FM999G990D00'),' mio') AS avg_per_player_mio,
    ROUND(SUM(f.gross_py_eur) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(f.gross_py_eur)) OVER (),1) AS pct_of_overall
FROM fact_contract f
JOIN dim_player  p USING (player_id)
GROUP BY p.pos_detail
ORDER BY SUM(f.gross_py_eur) DESC;
```

Insight: Only three clubs‚ÄîTrabzonspor, Kayserispor and G√∂ztepe‚Äîallocate a larger share of their wage bill to defenders; every other team channels the biggest slice into its forward line.
